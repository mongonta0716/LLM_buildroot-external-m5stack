# AX630C Buildroot external tree

include uboot linux-kernel msp
This repository is a Buildroot `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree dedicated to
supporting the [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/)
[AX630C](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/module/Module-LLM)
platforms. Using this project is not strictly necessary as Buildroot
itself has support for AX630C, but this `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree provide
example configurations demonstrating how to use the different features
of the AX630C platforms.

## Available configurations

This `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree provides ten example Buildroot
configurations:

1. `m5stack_module_llm_4_19_defconfig`, which is a minimal configuration to
   support the AX630C LLM Discovery Kit board. It builds the U-Boot bootloader, Linux kernel
   and a minimal user-space composed of just Busybox.

2. `m5stack_ax630c_lite_4_19_defconfig`, which is a minimal configuration to
   support the AX630C Kit Discovery Kit 
   board. It builds the U-Boot bootloader, Linux kernel
   and a minimal user-space composed of just Busybox.

Note that upstream Buildroot also contains pre-defined configurations
for AX630C platforms, but they use the upstream versions of U-Boot and Linux, 
while the configurations in this `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree
use the versions provided and supported by M5STACK.

## Starter package

If want to use Buildroot on AX630C platforms without building
everything yourself from source, we provide below a *Starter
Package*. For each release and each Buildroot configuration, we
provide:

* A README file that documents how the *Starter Package* has been
  built

* A pre-built image, ready to flash on an SD card, together with a
  *Block map* (which can be used with `bmaptool` to optimize the
  flashing process). This image contains a fully working system, with
  Linux kernel and root filesystem. Look at the [flash
  and boot section](#Flashing-and-booting-the-system) to discover how
  to use the prebuilt images.

* A Software Development Kit (SDK) that contains a cross-compiler and
  set of libraries that allow you to build applications for the
  target. See the Buildroot [advanced usage
  documentation](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_advanced_usage)
  to find out how to use the SDK.

* The complete list of open-source licenses and complete source code
  of all software components included in the pre-built image, for
  license compliance.

## Building Buildroot from source

### Pre-requisites

In order to use [Buildroot](https://www.buildroot.org), you need to
have a Linux distribution installed on your workstation. Any
reasonably recent Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Redhat,
OpenSuse, etc.) will work fine.

Then, you need to install a small set of packages, as described in the
[Buildroot manual System requirements
section](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement).

For Debian/Ubuntu distributions, the following command allows to
install the necessary packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt install debianutils sed make binutils build-essential gcc g++ bash patch gzip bzip2 perl tar cpio unzip rsync file bc git
```

There are also optional dependencies if you want to use Buildroot features
like interface configuration, legal information or documentation.
Please see the [corresponding manual section](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement-optional).

#### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) Macs

This `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree bundles prebuilt **x86_64 Linux** binaries with
no source included (the `aarch64-none-linux-gnu` toolchain under
[toolchain/](toolchain/), and `tools/bin/ax_gzip`, `img2simg`,
`make_ext4fs`). These cannot run natively on macOS, nor on arm64 Linux,
so building directly on an Apple Silicon Mac (even inside an arm64
Linux VM) is not possible.

Instead, use the provided [docker/](docker/) setup, which builds and
runs an `x86_64` (`linux/amd64`) Ubuntu container. Docker Desktop
transparently emulates this via Rosetta on Apple Silicon, so the
bundled binaries run unmodified:

```bash
# from the directory containing both buildroot/ and this repo
$ ./LLM_buildroot-external-m5stack/docker/build.sh
root@...:/work/buildroot# make BR2_EXTERNAL=../LLM_buildroot-external-m5stack m5stack_module_llm_4_19_defconfig
root@...:/work/buildroot# make
```

You can also pass a command directly instead of getting a shell, e.g.
`./LLM_buildroot-external-m5stack/docker/build.sh make`.

### Getting the code

This `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree is designed to work with the `2023.02.x` LTS
version of Buildroot. However, we needed a few changes on top of
upstream Buildroot, so you need to use our own Buildroot fork together
with this `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree, and more precisely its `st/2023.02.10`
branch.

```bash
$ git clone -b st/2023.02.10 https://github.com/bootlin/buildroot.git
```

See our documentation on [internal details](docs/internals.md) for more
information about the changes we have compared to upstream Buildroot.

Now, clone the matching branch of the `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/m5stack/LLM_buildroot-external-m5stack.git
```

You now have side-by-side a `buildroot` directory and a
`buildroot-external-st` directory.

### Configure and build

Go to the Buildroot directory:

```bash
$ cd buildroot/
```

And then, configure the system you want to build by using one of the 4
*defconfigs* provided in this `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree. For example:

```bash
buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=../LLM_buildroot-external-m5stack m5stack_module_llm_4_19_defconfig
```

We are passing two informations to `make`:

1. The path to `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree, which we have cloned side-by-side
to the Buildroot repository

2. The name of the Buildroot configuration we want to build.

If you want to further customize the Buildroot configuration, you can
now run `make menuconfig`, but for your first build, we recommend you
to keep the configuration unchanged so that you can verify that
everything is working for you.

Start the build:

```bash
buildroot/ $ make
```

This will automaticaly download and build the entire Linux system for
your AX630C platform: cross-compilation toolchain, firmware,
bootloader, Linux kernel, root filesystem. It might take between 30
and 60 minutes depending on the configuration you have chosen and how
powerful your machine is.

## Flashing and booting the system

The Buildroot configurations generate a compressed ready-to-use SD card
image, available as `output/M5_LLM_buildroot_20241214.axp`. You can also use the
prebuilt images downloaded from the [starter package section](#Starter-package).
